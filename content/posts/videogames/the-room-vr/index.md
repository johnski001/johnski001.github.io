## Review
This game is the first game I have ever played in VR, and alse the first digital escape room so I have no other games to compare this game to. What I can say is that I was invested in the game from the moment I started playing this one. The scenery was nicely made and from the moment you start playing there is actually something to do.

The mechanics that are used in the game, like the different lenzes, are original and easy to understand. Puzzles are all different and you will never have the feeling that you are doing the same thing over and over again. This is actually a good game which doesn't take too long to complete. According to Steam I have beaten the game in 6,5 hours.

At this point in time, the Room VR costs you about 10 euro so the price is certainly ok for what you are getting in return. It is a game that was published in 2020 but if you haven't played it and you have a VR headset it's a no brainer that you have to give this a shot! So, what are yo uwaiting for, start investigating and join the thousands of people that rated this game as overwhelmingly positive!
